      We are creating dInvest to give everyone an easy to use, transparent, and decentralized way of investing money.
      We build a fund as a decentralized autonomous organization in the Ethereum network to allow users to invest cryptocurrency in our fund.
      The funds are used to invest into other cryptocurrencies, raw materials, and stocks.
      The idea is that users can withdraw their currency at any point potentially with a profit.

    <div class="row">
    This project resulted from a paper Dominik and Tharidu were working on to create an investment opportunity for individuals.
    As public reputation becomes one of the most important success factors beyond financial success, investment opportunities should ensure ethical decisions and keep sustainable investment as core of their strategy.
    Our hypothesis was, that a decentralized autonomous hedge fund implemented in a blockchain based on smart contracts is able to be profitable in comparison to benchmark indexes and investments follow sustainability criteria that are transparent to the investors.
